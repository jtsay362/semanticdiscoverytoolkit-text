 * When a node is split, the existing node is inserted under a new
 * node who shares the existing node's value before receiving a new
 * child. Replicators are called to duplicate that value into the
 * new node.
 * <p>
 * A replicator is not necessary for immutable values, but is essential
 * for proper function with values that contain changing state, which
 * is often the case with values that "merge".
